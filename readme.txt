You can also display custom fields, formatted with one of the following (no coding required):

* Standard text
* Prices (1,000.00 or 1.000,00)

= Powerful Filters =
Filter by date, author, status, category, and tag, all without refreshing. Mix and match your filters to create more specific queries, and sort your content in ascending or descending order.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Index includes native support for Yoast and All In One SEO ratings in the table view. If you run into any conflicts with publicly available plugins, please let us know in the support forum!
